#### [üìÑ Resume](https://github.com/VioletGabales/Portfolio/blob/main/Violet's%20Resume.pdf) 


My resume includes my headshot, contact information, education, experience, and skills. You will notice that in June 2024, I started my position as an organizational development consulting intern within BerryDunn's Medicaid Practice Group. Alongside my team, I've had the opportunity to expand my knowledge, skills, and experience in change management. I am happy to share that I will be joining BerryDunn full-time in July 2025.

## Projects
1. #### [üìÑ Change Management Practices](https://github.com/VioletGabales/Portfolio/blob/main/DMAIC%20%26%20ADKAR%20Basics%20Handout%20V2.%209.9.24%20(1).pdf)

In collaboration with my team's illustrative artist, I developed an overview of our change management team's approach to process improvement. The document provides an overview of Lean Six Sigma methodology, which we use to drive all change initiatives, as well as Prosci's ADKAR (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement) communications approach to managing change. ***Note: As this is an internal document from my work at BerryDunn, please do not download or share the document outside of ISM 6002. Thank you!***

2. #### [üìÑ Process Improvement Toolkit](https://github.com/VioletGabales/Portfolio/blob/main/Process%20Improvement%20Toolkit.pdf)

At the beginning of my internship, I teamed up with my OCM workstream lead to create a process improvement toolkit for internal BerryDunn use. The document introduces the foundations of process improvement, including Lean Six Sigma's DMAIC methodology, helpful tools and templates to use to navigate throughout the process, and guidance for right-sizing projects. ***Note: As this is an internal document from my work at BerryDunn, please do not download or share the document outside of ISM 6002. Thank you!***

3. #### [üìÑ Optimizing Workplace Motivation and Performance](https://github.com/VioletGabales/Portfolio/blob/main/Optimizing%20Workplace%20Performance-The%20Effects%20of%20Leadership%20Style%20and%20Conflict.pdf)

"Optimizing Workplace Motivation and Performance: The Effects of Leadership Style and Conflict" was developed for a team project throughout one of my Industrial-Organizational (IO) Psychology courses, Leadership and Teams (ORG 6003). The document shares key takeaways for enhancing employee motivation, and dives into why and how these takeaways were concluded.

4. #### [üìÑ Interviewing Leaders](https://github.com/VioletGabales/Portfolio/blob/main/Interviewing%20Leaders-A%20Reflection%20on%20Growth%20and%20Development.docx)

"Interviewing Leaders: A Reflection on Growth and Development" was also created with a team in ORG 6300. As a part of this project, each of my team members interviewed a manager or supervisor to uncover how and why they aim to develop leadership skills amongst their work teams. Each leader shared varying approaches to guiding and developing others within their organizations.
